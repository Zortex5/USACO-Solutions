# USACO-Solutions
A bunch of USACO (USA Computing Olympiad) problems I did. Not the full library of my solutions, but notable ones that were more on the difficult or more interesting side. I have included the links to the problem statements on each file for convenience.

Highlights:

usaco2018_Bronze_March: family.cpp

usaco2019_Silver_December: milkvisits.cpp

**usaco2019_Silver_January: perimeter.cpp**
